# Gamestop-PS5-Bot

## Why?
Playstation announced not too long ago the release of the PS5. I thought it would be a fun learning exercise to write a script that would essentially notify you via e-mail when a PS5 was available. It only works on the GameStop website at the moment, but I hope it serves as a stepping stone to make your own scripts too. ☺️


## Things to note
1. Sender & Receiver e-mail need to be set according to your preference.
2. The time between each HTTP request is 1 minute when it's not in stock and 2 seconds when it's available. You should configure this to your liking.
3. The dependencies are at the top and necessary to make it work and I wrote this using Python 3.8.3


## How to use?
In order to get this working, all you need to do is run `python3 checkStock.py` after you have the necessary dependencies.
